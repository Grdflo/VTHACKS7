44 It is also the only habitat of hundreds of endemic species 45 and hundreds of others which are severely restricted or threatened This enormous species diversity is mainly because the city is

iNaturalist City Nature Challenge in two out of the three categories Most Observations and Most Species This was the first entry by Capetonians in this annual competition to observe and record the local biodiversity over a four day long weekend during what is considered the worst time of the year for local observations 48 However a worldwide survey showed that the extinction rate of endemic plants from the City of Cape Town is one of the highest in the world at roughly three per year since 1900 partly a consequence of the very small and localised habitats and high endemicity 49
